The museum building outside and inside is incredibly beautiful. The medieval section has many beautiful pieces. I also enjoyed the China and Korea exhibit. That's all I had time to see! If you are in London don't miss this gem.

The curators have done an amazing job. A pretty big building, and every floor and every room is very well organized, the descriptions are interesting and make connections between the environment.
There are big spaces with huge sculptures, and cosy rooms with very fine and small pieces.
The cast room and it's collection could be even a separate museum. It was beautiful, must to see."

It states textiles, fashion, etc. but it is so much more than that. The cast room alone is worth the visit, truly.

There are various exhibitions to entertain and really wonderful to see a dance session which children could take part in, without a booking.

The museum has numerous galleries from famous gowns to modern creations (like Harry Styles cardigan) to paintings from different eras.
Their copies of originals such as that of Michelangelo's David are impressive to say the least.

Well worth the visit especially with the family as some of the objects can be interacted with-try tying a caveat or creating your own monogram."

It is hard to explain the feeling one gets when entering each part of the Victoria and Albert Museum. There is a lovely cafe if you need to get something to drink or eat so don’t stress.

Easy place to spend hour after hour after hour in and when driving home wonder if we should go back again tomorrow or next week

The building from the outside is stunning as well. I recommend going on a Sunday as it wasn’t busy.

Although this is renowned for being a museum. I have been here on several occasions for luxury brand events, each one better then the last.

Worth the visit if in London, the building is full of historical wonders. Should you attend an event, you are in for a treat. The V and A have a keen eye for detail alongside superior knowledgeable staff… what a remarkable museum!

A great free museum for adults to expand your knowledge & feed your curiosity with activities for children including hands on ceramics (advanced booking) interactive theatre displays with dress-up, Capability Brown tours and so much more!

The cafes feel special too albeit only Benugo - live piano music inside and sitting in the central courtyard is wonderful on a nice day (with a paddle in the fountain!)

Sadly one of the security guards was so harsh in manner towards my nephew when he reached out to touch a (well touched) bronze lion he will no longer to go to the V&A"

Beautiful space that is full of amazing art and artifacts. Perfect for families, with accessible spaces and lots to see.

The jewellery room was also fantastic and so was the new Design exhibit. The Buddhism / Japan / Korea rooms didn’t wow me - felt stale, just walls of items in glass cabinets. Also Buddhism was located next to the entrance so was extremely noisy. The shop could be improved, the range wasn’t amazing. They only had items relating to certain exhibitions. I love gift shops and I didn’t buy a single thing. Worth a visit to this museum along with the National history museum next door."

Considering men's fashion is underdeveloped to begin with, this exhibition only just begins to explore the scope of masculine fashion - not only does it barely explore the future of male fashion beyond some extremely mainstream examples at the very end of the show (infact we attended the graduate fashion show the next day which already explored much more interesting concepts in male fashion), but even it's retrospective was surface level at best and as a whole was unimaginatively presented.

Of course the rest of the museums permanent exhibits are great and truly of a world class standard, but my review reflects my first time attending a paid exhibition here, and it was not worth the money.

In addition to this, the cafe was quite expensive for drinks and you have to serve your own table (if you ask me, it should be one or the other, not both), so when visiting with family it means someone (me) roundtripping between the cafe counter and our table as the drinks became ready. Also the tables/chairs are ugly compared to the beauty of the tea room itself, as well as there being too many tables for the space, so it seemed crowded and much cheaper feeling than it should be."

There is just so much there that I wasn't expecting and we only covered the medieval, south asian and Islamic sections.  The museum is well laid out and there is plenty of seating if you need to sit and absorb things.  The information boards are also very good, both for individual items and the topic as a whole although that being said it is sometimes unclear which item the board is referring too as they aren't numbered.
The cafe is also good and has a nice variety of lunch and snack offerings.  This is now my second favourite place after the British Museum (the V&A that is, not the cafe!)."

This museum seems like a place from inside and contains antiques for Sicnic, Japanese, Arab (Mamluk, Andalusian), Turkic (Ottoman, Mongol), Indian (specifically mughal) and European civilisations, situated in places depicting the art of their time. The museum also has paintings and sculptures depicting indian, french, roman and greek legends of history.

You don't need a time machine to have a taste of different civilisations, this place will let you time travel through centuries.

On weekends the lights are switched on for all the antiques which allow to have a clear look, so I recommend visiting on weekends."

It is absolutely vast. The collection is quite eclectic. Ostensibly the museum has a collection with fashion clothing and jewellery but the collection goes way beyond those central themes. As with all major london museums entry is free although donations are strongly encouraged. There are also usually 2 special exhibitions which require an entry fee unless you’re a member - and also advance booking online. As at March 2022 the exhibitions are Faberge in London (exquisite and unmissable) and Beatrix Potter. Photos in the Faberge exhibition were not permitted so I used some photos of the Easter eggs and other Faberge creations from other collections (some now in London) to demonstrate their beauty.

When you go, look up their catagories and plan which ones to visit as you are instantly overwhelmed by all the beauty that assails your eyes that you are liable to stagger around agog! This, on reflection is another good way to see the museum, it's fun and very random! You choose!
Don't forget to visit the incredible indoor restaurant, it's so beautiful and the stained glass windows and lighting in this vaulted room will be such a treat, as well as the food!

There is so much to see and you would benefit from multiple visits.
Generally speaking, I think it's a museum for Adults as you need some life experience to really appreciate just what's on display. I remember being rather bored as a child (especially as the button pushing frenzy of the Science Museum and The Dinosaurs of The Natural History Museum were over the road...), but I really prefer it now. In the past, I visited the Bowie Exhibition which was phenomenal. A visit to London without visiting the V & A is a waste. Personal Favourite? Without doubt, The Cast Court. Quite literally replicas of artifacts made from plaster casting, including Trajan's column from the Forum in Rome ( and that is a large monument!). This would enable people in  Victorian Times to see things that they would never be able to afford to visit. Today, it means you can see these things as they were in the 1800s, before over a century of modern pollution. Quite astounding.

As we queued up to go inside, we admired the sculpted arches, columns, and window areas. It's notable that bombing damage from WWII has been preserved to show how close the museum came to being obliterated during the war, but I also think it's remarkable how often the Axis and Allies explicitly avoided destroying their enemies' cultural treasures.

There is far too much inside the museum to take in, just in a single visit. We focused mostly on the medieval and Renaissance galleries, but there is much, much more to see.

I think the most intriguing displays to me as an artist were the Cast Courts, which held casts or molds taken from original artworks (such as Trajan's Column in Rome, or Michealangelo's David) during the Victorian Era. These were brought back to England for artists to study, but also to help shape public tastes (for exple, so that the public could see what the real thing looked like and be more discerning in their artistic choices).

We also enjoyed examining Leighton's murals on Peace and on War."

Their collection is vast, and it is splendidly curated. I had a US acquaintance once ask 'How long would it take us to view the collection?' My reply was to ask 'How much longer do you expect to live?' Somewhat hyperbolic, perhaps, but hopefully conveyed my attitude.

This particular visit was focused on a brace of special exhibits; Stonehenge and Beatrix Potter.  Stonehenge is an immensely complex and elusive subject.  Shrouded in myth, mystery, and more than a little folderol, it is a huge challenge, to which the V&A rose admirably. Artifacts from collections across the world, presented in context and amply displayed and explained. This is a topic which might easily get out of hand. But their focus and moderation is superb.

Beatrix Potter is a model of accessibility for all ages, including young children. It is a bit as if her life and times step out of the pages and invite one in. Charming and informative."

I haven’t been here since before COVID lockdown and it is as amazing as before. You can never get tired of exploring and learning about all the exhibits here.

There are slight changes to getting in.
Even though mainly the museum is free (this is why I love the London, where they make art and museums free so everyone can enjoy and experience great pieces of art), you have to book a timed ticket to enter.
Just go on the website and choose a suitable time and date (I do miss just turning up and explore, but hopefully we can do that soon again).
And turn up about 15mins before your time. The entrance is now from Exhibition Road (see photo) and they will scan your ticket barcode (on your phone or if you printed it out.)
All COVID safe and staff are always helpful if you need it.

Everyone should really go and explore the V&A. Forget about using a map once you’re inside, just get lost and find something new, I always do. Don’t miss the Cast Courts and the Jewellery room as my favourites (also the pottery floor, I won’t tell you where it is, but follow my top tip and you won’t go wrong😉.)

My top tip, take the lift to the top of the museum and work your way down without using a map. You will come across many wonderful things. (Some of the upper floors are closed due to COVID. This includes the lifts at the main entrance)"

I didn't like Beatrix Potter's exhibition. I love her watercolours and drawings, but unluckily it was too dark inside and impossible to read the explanations and to properly see her drawings and paintings!

The only thing I appreciated were her small books as you could sit down and finally see her paintings printed in the book as there was a spot of light conveniently positioned that allowed the books to be read and the paintings to appreciated!!

Was it worth paying for the exhibition? Not as it was organized...."

I pre arranged a guide to take me around too and to take photos a few days before.

Coming to the V&A I had Laura meet me outside the museum, who was so lovely , upon making my way to see the exhibition there was an entry technicalities. Being autistic I did not know when buying an entry to the V&A . You had to buy another. It was not explained very well on website. Plus being autistic we sometimes have trouble processing information and understanding it. So here's me thinking the worse and I've traveled an hour and half only to find i can't see the exhibition. Laura went away to find another colleague about getting me a ticket to see the exhibition. She came back 5 mins later with said colleague ( never asked her name ) and Laura said we be able to get you a ticket today. Feeling relieved. The young lady ( same colleague who name i forget to ask) said here's a ticket. I was like thank you. I was about to pay for it. And she said free charge. I was like are you sure . She said yes , you enjoy you visit. The kindness of humans and empathy. I never expected a free ticket. Moving on I had a wonderful guide to assist me around the exhibition..her name was Caroline. She was wonderful too. She took photos and we chatted she made me feel very at ease and very comfortable. Caroline even took me to the shop to get a Alice in wonderland print and frame..than assisted me to lunch and we chatted more. As a person with Autism / adhd and a hidden disabilities. The V& A go above and beyond for those with disabilities be that hidden ones too. The thought that went into planning of me arriving. I have never known such a wonderful place with rare humans who go out there way to makes us ( autistic folk) feel welcomed and at ease and comfortable. Thanks to Laura / Caroline / and the other young lady who insisted I have a free ticket due to the entry technicalities. And to all the staff at the V&A . I am an autistic blogger and I mentioned these wonderful people and the museum. If your autistic or have a disability. The V&A will look after you from start to finish. I be back for more exhibitions and will be donating. Hoping to have Caroline again when I re visit. One very happy customer"

A shame though, as we came around 4pmish, google said it closes at 5:45pm but staff said it closed at 9pm. Turns out that a lot of the upper floors were closed by 5:45 and it seems the lower ground is open till 9. In which case, plan your visit to go top to bottom as opposed to bottom to top.

Covers lots of different areas of the world, wasn't too busy at all and we visited the bank holiday weekend & theres no need to order tickets anymore. So if the other museums are booked up, V&A is a safe bet and equally good."

Wonderful and totally fascinating. Always knew about the imperial Easter eggs but actually seeing them (alongside the other things the house of Faberge produced) is unbelievable. The intricacy and details of the eggs in the final room is mind blowing. My only gripe is that we couldn't see how the automatons within the eggs worked and what they looked like within the egg and working. The other items that Faberge produced or worked with other collaborators on, are gorgeous but the real stunners are the eggs themselves. Stunning. Suggest also going on a week day as the weekends are so busy but once you enter the exhibition, you can spend as long as you like."

The main purpose of visiting V&A museum was Epic Iran (exhibition for a limited time,until 12 September 2021) which  it was realy a good news to have the opprtunity to see the ancient heritagr of the great emire of the Arya in London. I think could have been better by  audio guide with persian translator and more  diverse persian music and more diverse declamation of persian poems. The contemporary section was not satisfactory at all. The dedicated light was not enough. The absence of the Miniator art and musical instruments of Iran was felt. Also it could have been better if  the DVD of the Epic Iran had been sold similar to its book."

We booked free tickets about a week in advance for the museum.
On arrival the reception  and checking in process by the staff were both speedy and efficient.
QR codes were used for both the entrance as well as to download the map of the museum.
I would certainly recommend both the fashion exhibition as well as section which consists of casts of some very well known large sculpture pieces such as Michaelangelo's David and Trajan's columns, as well as numerous effigies of English Nobility from the late middle ages. Other exhibits we viewed included a section on Religious items which included both numerous stained glass and Chalices, Crosses, Patens and Reliques and other religious items.
We spent an enjoyable and informative 3 hours touring the museum.
We also visited the museum cafe situated in the courtyard on the ground floor.
Although the offerings were limited it was certainly nice to be able to sit outside and enjoy a hot cup of coffee while taking a short break from all the exhibits.
We shall certainly be returning in the near future to view the rest of the exhibits that time did not allow  us to see, first among which is the Jewelry exhibition which was extremely busy when we tried to visit."

It’s a joke and I was not happy. aswell as the staff… clearly unhappy with their jobs and being stuck in those stuffy/unbearably hot rooms all day.
First we walked into the jewelry  room my friends phone had something playing on accident. The women told her if she could turn it down ok that’s fine then we opened a draw and it made a noice like they do she then walked up the stairs and said “don’t play with the draws like there your kitchen draws” ??? Ok. She then called the security guard and told them we were opening and slamming the draws which was very much a lie literally no one slammed the draw?
We then went to a room on the other side of the building and was taking a picture next to the display. The lady popped out from nowhere  saying “don’t touch the display please” firstly now your ruining our picture and secondly ?? your following us like comon now this is ridiculous? She was then hiding round the corner for us to make any noice when we did she came round telling us to “behave”??? After this a kind young lady came up to ask  if we knew where the tour guides were. We told her there was a women at the front. When we left the room she was still patiently waiting there. Why? Bc the women isn’t there and is to busy trying to follow us and moan at any little thing instead of doing her job. It’s a joke and this needs to be investigated ASAP do your job women and stop stalking us"

The V&A is located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area known as ""Albertopolis"" because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall and Imperial College London. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As with other national British museums, entrance is free. The V&A covers 12.5 acres (5.1 ha)[5] and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5,000 years of art, from ancient times to the present day, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa. However, the art of antiquity in most areas is not collected. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world."

Said to be the worlds oldest museum restaurant the period rooms are just amazing and I sat there for ages just gazing at the walls and the ceiling. There is a piano there as well,  so our refreshments were accompanied by a talented pianist twinkling away. As the museum is free admission, there is no need to visit the museum to come and have coffee or tea and the prices are pretty comparable with the normal High Street chains selling coffee locally."

A place where all cultures and countries, 💎 diamonds and weapons, 🖼 art and design of all centuries and countries are in one place (it represents more than 3,000 years of human creativity)!
This place will charm you with it’s architecture and interior design! If you like more architecture and history then the right level to start your way will be the first floor but if you like more 🖼 art or design, then the right floor to start will be from the top floor!
The museum if free of charge, just few of events carry a separate charge, for example: Dior and Mary Quant which are one of the most unique exhibitions and if you are for the first time in London then you must visit this place!
By the way, what about Buddhism? Or maybe you prefer more a Samurai than Buddha 😜? Or maybe both...? Get ready to dive into the Asia’s surprising culture and it’s unbelievable full of colours history.
This and many more cultures you will find inside... just bear in mind that if you want to see the whole museum with all of it’s beauties and exhibitions then you will need at least 2 full days!
After a long busy day the best place to go will be a nice cafe at the back of the museum in a nice garden where meals, coffees, teas and prossecos are served! Think this will be a nice end of the day!
I definitely recommend this place to everyone and any age😉!"

It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The V&A is located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area known as ""Albertopolis"" because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall and Imperial College London. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As with other national British museums, entrance is free. The V&A covers 12.5 acres (5.1 ha) and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5000 years of art, from ancient times to the present day, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa. However, the art of antiquity in most areas is not collected. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world. The museum owns the world's largest collection of post-classical sculpture, with the holdings of Italian Renaissance items being the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection is amongst the largest in the Western world. Overall, it is one of the largest museums in the world. Since 2001, the museum has embarked on a major £150m renovation programme. New 17th- and 18th-century European galleries were opened on 9 December 2015. These restored the original Aston Webb interiors and host the European collections 1600–1815. The Young V&A in East London is a branch of the museum, and a new branch in London is being planned. The first V&A museum outside London, V&A Dundee opened on 15 September 2018."

Everyone can find there something of interest and you can easily spend a full day there exploring without noticing how the times passed by.
If it's your first time in the museum, I'd advise to take a free one hour introductory tour (daily at 10.30, 12.30, 13.30 and 15.30) which will introduce you a selection from the Museum's outstanding collections, after this tour you will have better understanding which part of its vast collection you'd want to explore more.
Free activities for children are available every day and special workshops run during school holidays. Galleries are fully accessible.
The building itself and the central court are beautiful (and beautifully lit in the evening). You should also not miss their  Main Café, the world's oldest museum restaurant with its charming Victorian era design."

My favorite part was the architecture section. It was full of impressive models and replicas, with comprehensive explanations and an all in all enjoyable experience.

I love glass art, and I have to admit that I was not impressed by the contemporary glass art section, but the traditional glass art section was lovely. The stairs leading to the top floor fantastically mimicked the glass, and together with the level to ceiling mirror at the end of the room, you have the impression of entering some glass castle filled with art.

The status may make one of the most extensive collections of the museum, but you will have a great time exploring some of the hidden away gems the place is filled with."

The museum is open till late on Friday. However, many galleries were closed to visitors, don’t know for what reasons. I missed the painting gallery at the top floor, as the entire gallery was closed.

I felt 2-3 best galleries in the museum are: (1) photography gallery - great collection, a time sequence arrangement, which helps an amateur like me to understand the evolution. Many rare and early photographs of mid-19th century are fascinating. Evolution of photographic equipments also is quite educational. (2) South Asian gallery - being from that region, it was great to see artifacts related to Tipu, Ranjit Singh ji, and quite a few paintings from the east India during Alivardi and Siraj.

I loved the cafe, and someone playing the piano there. I wished it had some more English dishes available for evening snacks. Coffee was fantastic.

My biggest complaint is with the museum store. The museum’s collection is full of so many iconic artifacts. However, there’s very few mementos related to these, e.g., post cards, magnets etc. The V&A book is great, but I expected lot more from the store."

It's worth visiting just to see the building itself. Combining large airy spaces, with natural light coming from the rooftop domes. Balconies running around, providing a different perspective and sympathetic modern additions gives you plenty to look at.

The huge variety of the free exhibits also means that everyone will find something that catches their eye, even those with no special reason for going here.

And as it's free, it's your choice how long you stay, because you can always come back again and see more.

Each exhibit has a brief written description. There are also curators in each area who can answer any questions. In addition there's computer terminals to use, where you can access the museum's website and search exhibits using the items code number.

The museum is fully accessible, with lifts to all floors and gentle ramps up to the entrance.

Toilet facilities and a good café are on site to make sure your visit is as pleasant as possible.

By focusing on targeted areas within the museum we were able to enjoy a comprehensive visit, while conserving our energy and not moving around from one end of the museum to the other to see certain highlights.

Starting at the Medieval to Renaissance rooms on Level 0 and 1, as the museum opened at 10am, we proceeded to spend around 90 minutes viewing these gallery rooms as well as the nearby Raphael and Cast Court rooms, showcasing artefacts, sculptures, writings and other items from the Middle Ages, Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance and Rocco periods. Items on display are spaced nicely and just lovely to inspect. Some of the decorative church doorways that have been reconstructed here are remarkable to look at.

We then proceeded upstairs to the Britain galleries (1500-1760AD) on the second floor and (1760-1900AD) on the forth floor, followed by the Sculpture rooms (1300 - 1600AD) found back on the ground floor, near the gift shop. These sections required another 75 minutes to browse. The highlights included the splendid 'Great Bed of Ware’ collection and many of the sculptures seen in the The Dorothy and Michael Hintze Galleries (rooms 21-24).

In the end, we found that concentrating our efforts on a smaller section of the museum had many advantages. We were able to visit sections of the V&A Museum that were most interesting to us personally and spend plenty of time, comprehensively looking over most of the collection in these galleries and rooms. We also didn't feel as tired due to not racing around the entire museum trying to visit selected highlights scattered throughout.

Regardless of how you decide to visit the V&A museum, we highly recommend spending a bit of time getting to know about the museum prior to your visit. This will greatly enhance your experience when you are there. We also highly suggest paying the (£1 donation) and using the V&A brochure map to help navigate your way around. Other helpful tips for how to visit can be found on our previous review for the Victoria and Albert Museum."

Seriously loved it. We’d go back again and probably fill another day. Which you could, as its free.

It’s hard to explain what it is and what it isn’t in terms of collections or themes, but we’d go as far to say that you will find plenty of things to examine that you probably never knew anything about.

The interesting thing about this museum is its breath of history and object. I'm not sure yet but it may become my favorite museum ever visited.

This museum is much more relatable than many I've been to before. It has furniture, fashion, daily use items from different eras around the world. The exhibitions are very nicely designed, whole rooms to fit the theme of different time periods. It paints a really good picture of what life used to be back in the days. Expect to spend the whole day here as there are a lot of collections, entry is free but there are a few paid areas. The outdoor courtyard surrounded by the beautiful old architecture is a perfect spot for lunch and a break from the museum. It was also quite empty even though it was Sunday so if you want to avoid the crowds and queues of the more popular museums such as the natural history or the British museum, Victoria and Albert is definitely a must see."

The cast courts is probably my favourite part of the whole museum. It feels so immersive, especially the inside of Trajan's Column - the perfect place to chill out for a moment.

If I had to pick fault the food offerings could be improved with better value for money - but that’s like most of the museums around this area. Luckily there are plenty of good places around so plan your visit and eat before/after your visit.

Be aware that luggage and items can/must be checked for a fee before entering the museum. If you are carrying alcohol, you must unpack it and leave it at the front security desk before putting the rest of your belongings in the baggage check. It's rather bizarre and if you're unprepared for it, you will be digging a bottle of whiskey out from between your knickers and dirty laundry in front of a line of people waiting to get inside. The Garden Cafe is in large, beautiful rooms and a good spot to have a drink and light fare, though the food and drinks are expensive and take a long time of queuing to order and receive.

There is an immense variety of funiture design on display with insightful free audio commentary from the curators offering insight into each designer and their work. A large collection Rodin's beautiful work is on display and was one of the highlights of my visit. There are also extensive collections of jewellery design and silverware on display. The beautiful V&A building also contains an outside courtyard with a shallow waterfall for children or even older chdren to play in. The courtyard was the perfect end to a fascinating day and a beautiful place to rest after all the walking.

Wonderfully curated with exhaustive collections on every single design topic imaginable. The building itself is one of London's greatest wonders - admire the original terracotta facade from the John Madejski Garden. For new visitors: Take a free tour with one of the extremely knowledgable docents for an overview of the museum's history, unparalleled collection, and mission. For people who live in London and can afford it, consider becoming a member.

Clearly Brendan is no a 'car guy' and the exibition is better for it as his perspective is not blinkered or obsessed by the choice of cars on display; yes there are some interesting choices that make you think, why that car; yes there are a few obvious choices and yes there a few omissions, many might moan that there is no Issigonis mini for instance, but we all know that story as its been told a million times. There are elements of the exibition that betray Brendan's transatlantic heritage but overall the exibition comes together and there are some interesting themes that connect the evolution of the motor industry the broader economic and industrial development during the 20th century.
